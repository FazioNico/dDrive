# dDrive - Decentralized Drive System 

## Project Description
dDrive is a fully decentralized and open-source Storage which replace traditional storage providers having centralized governance, cumbersome infrastructure, inadequate security and privacy measures with users datasets. 

dDrive is build on top of IPFS and inherits all the features of Blockchain Technology to emerge as an immutable, censorship-resistant, tamper-proof and privacy complient with user dataset.

## Value Proposition
dDrive integrat IPFS Core powered by Filecoin to enable users to store, manage and share their files in a decentralized way. Few of the core value propositions are:

1 Increased User Adoption: 
  Providing a smooth and intuitive process with seamless user experience to store, manage and share files in a decentralized way will increase the adoption of IPFS and Filecoin.

2 Real-world utility: 
  dDrive provide a real-world utility for censorship-resistant, tamper-proof and privacy complient storage solution by providing multi services composition that allow users to store and share files with total privacy and security controls of data access by using Encryption and Decryption technologies to increase data acces security.
